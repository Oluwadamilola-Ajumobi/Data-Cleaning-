# Data-Cleaning-This is a data cleaning with python project

Dirty data can appear because of duplicate values, mis-spellings and wrong labels, data-type parsing errors or incorrect data. Most data professionals do data cleaning 20-60% of the time, this is one of the major skills to have as a data professional.  
Each datatype has its unique format and incorrect datatype labelling can result in wrong information on charts and visualizations, bad prediction, mis-information and mis-leadings.                                                                                       
Datatypes with Examples

2. Categories - Marriage status, gender
3. Decimals - Temperature, Exchange rate
4. Integers - Subscribers, products sold
5. Dates - Order date, shipping date, birth date
6. Binary -yes/no, true/false, is_married. It is extremely important ensure that variables have the correct datatype.
